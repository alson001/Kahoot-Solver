## Notes
üìù The script utilizes screen coordinates for identifying the areas to capture screenshots for both questions and answers. Adjustments might be necessary if your screen resolution differs or if Kahoot's layout undergoes changes.

ü§ñ The bot relies on informed assumptions derived from the data it receives. There is no absolute guarantee that it will consistently provide accurate answers, particularly when questions involve visual elements like images or videos.
